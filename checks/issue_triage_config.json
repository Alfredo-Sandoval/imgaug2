This issue looks like a support/how-to question, an outdated install problem, or a feature request we are not planning to implement here, so I'm going to close it to keep the tracker focused.\n\nIf you can provide a minimal reproducible example and can show it's a bug in imgaug2 (not environment-specific), feel free to open a new issue with: versions, small code snippet, and expected vs actual behavior.",
