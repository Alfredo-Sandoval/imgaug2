# Generated API Reference

This section is an **auto-generated API reference** built from the library’s
docstrings using `mkdocstrings`.

It is intended to complement the curated docs:

- curated docs: best for learning and best-practice usage
- generated reference: best for completeness and “what methods exist?”

If you are trying to build a pipeline quickly, start with:

- [Augmenter Index (Cheat Sheet)](../../augmenters/augmenter_index.md)
- [Basics](../../examples/basics.md)
- [All Augmentables Together](../../examples/all_augmentables.md)

## Scope

Generated pages can be large. Use your browser search (or MkDocs search) to jump
to the class/function you want.
